            Welcome to my blog & portfolio 
          </h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is  <span class="highlight">Daniel</span> and I am a <span class="highlight">Computer Engineering</span> student in the Alicante's universitity.</p>
          <p>The goal of this blog is to create a space where I can share all the projects I work on and the solutions I develop for <span class="highlight">LeetCode challenges</span>, 
             accompanied by clear and detailed explanations. It also serves as my personal <span class="highlight">portfolio</span> & a place to showcase my growth
             as a <span class="highlight">computer engineer</span>, reflect on what I learn along the way, and hopefully contribute to others who are on a similar path.

            About Me
          </h2>
          <span class="highlight"></span>
          <p>
            I'm a <span class="highlight">tech</span> enthusiast who enjoys breaking down complex problems and building smart, elegant 
            solutions. I'm currently a first-year <span class="highlight">Computer Engineering</span> student, still early in my journey, but already deeply passionate about building
            things that are useful and efficient. What draws me to <span class="highlight">software development</span> is the <span class="highlight">problem solving process</span> it feels like tackling 
            complex puzzles, only more rewarding and with real world impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            I mainly work with <span class="highlight">C</span> and <span class="highlight">C++</span>, and I use <span class="highlight">Python</span> for math-related tasks. I've also worked with <span class="highlight">MySQL</span>, and recently started learning 
            <span class="highlight">Rust</span> out of personal interest, attracted by its focus on <span class="highlight">performance and memory safety</span>. <span class="highlight">Java</span> is on the horizon as part of my 
            university curriculum.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of what I know, I've learned through curiosity and persistence reading, experimenting, and figuring things out by myself. 
            I often rely on resources like <span class="highlight">Stack Overflow</span> or AI tools to refine my understanding or explore new ideas, but I always aim to 
            keep the process hands-on and meaningful. This very website is a small example of that approach: every detail here is 
            something I've designed, questioned, and improved along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't yet have a fixed path within tech, but I'm particularly interested in <span class="highlight">application development</span> both <span class="highlight">desktop</span> and <span class="highlight">mobile</span>
            and in building highly optimized and <span class="highlight">clean backends</span>. I believe it's an area that often gets overlooked but makes a huge 
            difference in real world performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of coding, I'm also someone with a deep passion for <span class="highlight">sports</span>, especially martial arts. I hold a brown belt in 
            Judo, and currently, I'm training in both <span class="highlight">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</span> and 
            <span class="highlight">Grappling</span>. These disciplines not only keep me active but also challenge my discipline, 
            strategy, and resilience.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a big fan of <span class="highlight">video games</span>. I enjoy a wide variety from Metroidvania titles like Hollow Knight 
            and Blasphemous, to sandbox experiences such as Stardew Valley and Minecraft, or fast paced fighters like Dragon Ball: 
            Sparking! ZERO. However, my all-time favorite genre is RPGs, particularly the <span class="highlight">Souls</span> series, 
            including Demon's Souls, Dark Souls (1, 2 & 3), Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond that, I also enjoy <span class="highlight">cooking</span> especially for the people I love, like my mom, my brother, and 
            my girlfriend. And when I have some downtime, I like to relax by watching <span class="highlight">anime</span> or reading some 
            <span class="highlight">manga</span>.
